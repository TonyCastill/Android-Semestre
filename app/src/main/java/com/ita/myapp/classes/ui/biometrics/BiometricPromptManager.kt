     * of a sealed class are known at compile time. No other subclasses
     * may appear outside the module and package within which the sealed
     * class is defined.
     *
     * The same logic applies to sealed interfaces and their
     * implementations: once a module with a sealed interface
     * is compiled, no new implementations can be created.
     *
     * When you combine sealed classes and interfaces with the when
     * expression, you can cover the behavior of all possible subclasses
     * and ensure that no new subclasses are created to affect your code adversely.
     *
     * Enum classes
     *
     * enum class is a special type of class used to define a set of constants.
     * It is often used when you need a predefined set of possible values for a
     * particular variable, like states, types, or categories. Enum classes can
     * contain constants, properties, and methods.
     *
     *
     * Since in this example we need objects to be able to behave different from other
     * objects (use arguments or not), we used a sealed interface
